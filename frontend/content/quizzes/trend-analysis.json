    "options": [
      "Linear Regression",
      "Random Forest",
      "K-Means Clustering",
      "Naive Bayes"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Linear regression produces a slope and intercept that quantify the monthly trend."

  {
    "question": "Across the full year, Tickets fall from 1,420 in January to 1,110 in December. Approximately how many tickets does the trend lose per month?",
    "options": [
      "About 28 tickets",
      "About 12 tickets",
      "About 60 tickets",
      "About 150 tickets"

    "question": "How many months show ResolvedWithinSLA at or above 0.90?",
    "options": [
      "Six months (July through December)",
      "Three months (October through December)",
      "All twelve months",
      "Only January"

    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "SLA meets or exceeds 0.90 from July onward, covering six months."
  },
  {
    "question": "If you regress Tickets on month index, what slope sign do you expect?",
    "options": [
      "Negative, indicating a steady decline",
      "Positive, indicating acceleration",
      "Zero, indicating a flat line",
      "Undefined, because regression cannot use monthly data"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Tickets decrease consistently, so the fitted slope should be negative."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which intervention note should you annotate when explaining the mid-year SLA jump?",
    "options": [
      "Self-service launch in June",
      "New year backlog in January",
      "Promo overflow in August",
      "Holiday pilot in November"

    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "The self-service launch coincides with SLA improving from 0.88 to 0.89 and continuing upward."

  {
    "question": "What relationship would a scatter plot of Tickets (x-axis) versus NPS (y-axis) likely reveal?",
    "options": [
      "Negative correlation: as tickets fall, NPS rises",
      "Positive correlation: both increase together",
      "No discernible pattern",
      "Cyclical swings every quarter"

    "answerIndex": 0,

      "The final quarter (October–December)",

    "explanation": "Holding out the most recent quarter tests whether the model generalizes to the latest behavior."
