    "question": "When comparing North and South region sales for each month in the Interpreting Data Sample CSV, which chart communicates the differences most clearly?",
    "options": [
      "Clustered column chart with one bar per region per month",
      "Pie chart with one slice per month",
      "Radar chart that mixes units and returns",
      "Table with no color or emphasis"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "A clustered column chart keeps the zero baseline, aligns categories, and highlights the South region spike in March."
  },
  {
    "question": "You want to show how South region returns change as sales increase. Which visual best uncovers this relationship?",
    "options": [
      "Scatter plot of Sales vs. Returns with point labels",
      "Stacked area chart of Sales and Returns",
      "Horizontal bar chart sorted by Sales",
      "Gauge chart with a single needle"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Scatter plots keep both metrics numeric, letting you see that higher sales in March come with higher returns."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why must quantitative bar charts retain a zero baseline?",
    "options": [
      "The length of each bar encodes magnitude from zero",
      "Viewers expect every chart to include zero by default",
      "Legends no longer work without it",
      "Axes cannot be resized in Mango"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Truncating the baseline distorts the perceived difference and can exaggerate tiny changes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which situation is a warning sign that a chart might mislead?",
    "options": [
      "Dual axes with different scales and no annotation",
      "Descriptive title summarizing the key outcome",
      "Color palette aligned to brand guidelines",
      "Tooltips that surface raw values"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Unlabeled dual axes make it hard to compare series honestly and should be avoided or clearly explained."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which month from the sample CSV deserves an annotation when plotted as a line chart?",
    "options": [
      "March, when South sales jump to 88,000",
      "January, when both regions are equal",
      "April, when returns disappear entirely",
      "June, when the dataset has missing rows"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Marchâ€™s festival surge is the biggest deviation from the baseline trend and should be called out."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you avoid over-encoding when building a scatter bubble chart?",
    "options": [
      "Limit the number of encoded dimensions to those that reinforce the message",
      "Always add both size and color encodings even if they duplicate",
      "Use 3D depth to impress viewers",
      "Hide the legend to keep focus on the points"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Each encoding should add new information; redundant encodings overwhelm interpretation."
  },
  {
    "question": "When might a stacked area chart backfire?",
    "options": [
      "When categories do not share the same baseline and viewers need to compare individual magnitudes",
      "When you are showing cumulative totals",
      "When you want to emphasize seasonality in a single series",
      "When the audience expects to see composition over time"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Stacked areas hide individual trends unless viewers focus on the top layer; use them only when composition is the goal."
